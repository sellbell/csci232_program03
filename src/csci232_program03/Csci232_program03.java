 * 
 * Overview:
 * - Program to gain experience with graphs and 
 *      implementation of common graph algorithms
 * - read graphs from comma separated files containing adjacency matrices
 *      using file relative paths
 * - implement 3 graphing methods:
 *      1. Prim's Algorithm - to find minimum spanning tree for weighted graph
 *      2. Kruskal's Algorithm - to find minimum spanning tree for weighted graph
 *      3. Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm - to find length of the shortest path b/t
 *          all pairs of vertices for weighted connected simple graph
 * - display step-by-step changes to adjacency matrix as console output
